    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>My name is Elvina and I have a passion. </h2>

     <h2>   I grew up in a small town where video games or technologies in general weren't of much of an interest to people. Except my older sister. It is her fault I fell into the beautiful trap of video games. I still remember the first time I got my hands on such a game.. I was in love ever since. 
    </h2>
       
     <h2>   I ended up delving into this world more and more. Oh and the stories I found. They did not just entertain me or provided me fun, no, they changed me. I think that is one of the most beautiful things that games can do. Influence and change. They stay with you. That is the kind of art I want to be a part of.
